NSA Overview 

The professionals at the National Security Agency (NSA) have one common goal: to protect our nation.  The mission requires a strong offense and a steadfast defense.  The offense collects, processes, and disseminates intelligence information derived from foreign signals for intelligence and counterintelligence purposes.  The defense prevents adversaries from gaining access to sensitive classified national security information. 

At NSA, mathematics and statistics are core disciplines and are present in every aspect of the mission.  

Mathematical Statisticians bring a wealth of expertise including, but not limited to, regression, machine learning, exploratory data analysis, stochastic processes, and statistical modeling and forecasting.  They work on some of the hardest problems associated with signals intelligence (the interception, collection, and analysis of foreign signals) and cybersecurity (assuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information). 

Mathematical Statisticians have the opportunity to learn and experiment in areas far from their academic training. These opportunities and core mission needs help make NSA the largest employer of mathematicians in the country.  

Description of Position

NSA is actively seeking mathematical statisticians to join a vibrant community of mathematicians, statisticians, physicists, computer scientists, and other intelligence professionals.

Newly-hired mathematical statisticians begin their careers in the Mathematics Development Program (MDP).  The goal of the three-year MDP is to train mathematical statisticians to be broadly knowledgeable in the spectrum of mathematical sciences used at NSA.  To accomplish this goal, MDP members study cryptologic mathematics and related subjects in Agency taught classes and complete 6-month tours in diverse NSA offices.  Graduates of the MDP may choose their first permanent assignments from any of the NSA Directorates, depending on availability.

The Agency is unique in its ability to offer the opportunity to work in diverse areas of Applied Statistics.  In addition to cryptologic mathematics, statisticians work in: 

- Signals analysis
- Data compression
- Machine learning 
- Data science
- Human language technology
- Speech/image/video processing
- Analysis of communication networks
- Network vulnerability analysis
- Cybersecurity 

Additionally, computing is an essential component of the mathematical sciences at NSA and statisticians must use a variety of computing platforms to test ideas and implement solutions. While there is no specific requirement for any previous programming or computing experience, a mathematical statistician must be willing to learn to use computers effectively.
Skills
Candidates should possess: 

- Strong problem-solving and analytical abilities
- Desire for continual learning
- Ability to work effectively independently and within teams across functional areas  

Knowledge and experience in one or more of the following is desired, but not required:  

- Programming expertise
