We connect patients with clinical trials, help clinicians order our test and receive our clinical reports, and deliver valuable genomic datasets to researchers to help uncover important insights into treatment paradigms and drug discovery. Our technology stack reflects our views of using the best tools for the job, employing Java, Python, Ruby along with Kubernetes, Docker, Mule, MySQL, MongoDB, high-performance computing clusters (HPC), and a variety of AWS services to analyze and disseminate vast volumes of genomic data.

** Involves travel up to 50% **


LOCATION: Greater Atlanta, SW side. 1 hour + drive from downtown.


Pay: $71K-108K depending on experience. Pay range coincides with 5-15 yrs of experience

Appropriate Titles Held: Will consider process engineers and new product development engineers who are willing to take on a travel-based role OR a someone recently in an applications engineering role.


THE COMPANY
This is your chance to work with a global, flexible plastic packaging company providing high level engineering support at this Georgia plant.  The company has manufacturing on 3 continents.

THE JOB
This job is the liaison among sales, R&D, and production. You will travel with the sales team to many customer locations in efforts to provide a technical / engineering and creative voice in discussions related to new business.

Your role will interact with the sales crew that is growing a portion of the company portfolio that is not considered this plant’s ‘core product,’ but are also not uncharted waters. Much of the team interaction you will have will be with sales and customers, on the floor, running trials, testing products, and designing experiments to work out the kinks in new product trials. Desk work will include data management (BOM, routings, costing), patent research, quality and specification planning, and preparing presentations.
