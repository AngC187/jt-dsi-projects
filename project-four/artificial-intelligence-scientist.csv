Job Description -Multi-Hypothesis Tracking (MHT) has been the standard for multi-target, multi-sensor fusion for decades. Recently, graph-based approaches have become popular. Can Random Finite Sets (RFS) improve the computational and functional performance over both?-Traditionally, data association has focused on hard-hard or soft-soft association. Hard-soft data fusion has come about much more recently - how can we associate video tracks of tanks to chat logs of intelligence analysts talking about tanks?-Social media by itself represents a massive amount of information. Can we combine it with traditional data sources like SIGINT and MASINT to do even more?These are actual problems that the scientists and researchers in I2A are working to solve every day.  As a scientist in I2A, you will work in small to medium groups of researchers and engineers on projects that typically last 1-3 years. Working on different projects keeps things new and interesting, but the projects don't just stop when our research stops. I2A is part of FAST Labs, which acts as the research and development core of Electronic Systems' five other business areas. Once we finish the research, we work to transition our programs to those business areas. Our tracking, fusion, and analytic algorithms go to the Command, Control, Communications, and Computers Intelligence, Surveillance, and Recognizance Systems (C4ISR) business area to improve their products that are used by military and intelligence analysts every day. Or they may go to the Electronic Combat Solutions (ECS) business area to add capability to their electronic warfare systems installed on aircraft like the F-35 or B-2. By sitting at the heart of BAE Systems' R&D organization, our research has a direct path through the greater company to enhance the capabilities of American soldiers.A data association scientist at the senior level is expected to design, develop, execute, and implement research projects at the sub-system level, and might be responsible for leading a small team. Technical writing is important, as you will frequently contribute to or co-author conference papers, journal articles, and/or invention disclosures, and support business development through idea generation, contributing to proposals, and/or authoring white papers. The senior scientist typically briefs technical results directly to project management or the customer.  Typical Education & Experience Bachelor's Degree and 5 years work experience or equivalent experienceRequired Skills and Education We are looking for scientists with foundations skills in one or more of the following who are interested in learning more: 
We use combinatorial optimization to choose which sensor observations are generated by the same objects.
We use Integer Linear Programs (ILPs) to associate measurements optimally, subject to data association constraints (e.g. a measurement can describe at most one target)
Understanding the data that sensors produce is critical to developing data association algorithms. We use data analysis to understand sensor phenomenology including biases, errors, dropouts, etc. Data analysis also informs us about how detection algorithms operate on radar, electro-optical, and signal data, etc.
Modeling and simulation enables multi-resolution modeling of complex systems: we can run a low-fidelity radar simulation on thousands of targets, or we can run a high-fidelity simulation on a smaller number of targets. 
Additionally, M&S allows us to couple our data association algorithms with sensor resource managers and learning algorithms: our data association algorithms estimate the world around us, and task sensors to investigate specific entities.
Probability and statistics provide the foundation for most of our data association algorithms. We use them to formulate statistical models, perform Bayesian inference, and update our understanding of the world.
All of this is typically prototyped in a high level language like MATLAB or Python before being ported to C++, and our scientists frequently present our algorithms and results to customers and at conferences. Keywords:

We are seeking a postdoctoral researcher to work in a small, agile team at the NASA Research Park on SGT, Inc.’s multi-year QUASAR project (Quantifiable Assurance Cases for Trusted Autonomy), part of the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Assured Autonomy research program.The successful candidate will undertake fundamental research into the foundations of Dynamic Assurance Cases (DACs), which aim to provide quantified assurance of trustworthiness in the design and operations of learning-enabled cyber-physical systems (LE-CPSs), for two autonomous system platforms.The postdoctoral researcher selected for this position will be responsible for directly contributing to two core research components of the assurance quantification work under QUASAR:
Developing suitable, quantifiable measures that relate to the assurance properties of an LE-CPS, in particular safety and correctness, with particular focus on the learning/autonomy functionality;
Developing and applying models for quantification of the assurance measures, based on risk scenarios, and the elements of a dynamic assurance case (DAC), along with data obtained from engineering analysis, verification, and operational/runtime monitoring. It is expected that the quantification approach will leverage a probabilistic approach so as to provide a rigorous, formal treatment of uncertainty, and to capture the stochastic nature of the overall system.
In addition to basic research, the researcher will apply the assurance quantification approach developed to the LE-CPS platforms within the Assured Autonomy Program, as part of the overall demonstration effort. In so doing, performing system and software safety analysis, developing risk scenarios, and undertaking risk assessment and apportionment may be required. The researcher would thus be expected to balance and contribute to both the research goals, and the practical engineering efforts within QUASAR. The successful candidatee will also contribute to implementation of the research results by designing algorithms and specifying the functionality required for implementing the assurance quantification approach in AdvoCATE, the Assurance Case Automation Toolset, for developing DACs. This is an opportunity to be involved at the leading edge of safety engineering and assurance technology, as applied to autonomous systems.Required Skills
Deep knowledge of, and substantial working experience with, probabilistic modeling and analysis, in particular Bayesian probability and statistics, and uncertainty modeling, propagation, and analysis.
Familiarity with graphical probabilistic models, e.g., Bayesian Networks, Dynamic Bayesian Networks, and Markov models.
Familiarity with the application of static/dynamic fault trees, event trees, and probabilistic models to safety and reliability analysis.
Working knowledge of dependability and safety analysis techniques and principles.
Working experience with developing, implementing, and applying statistical inference algorithms using packages/languages such as R, MATLAB/Bayes Net Toolbox, Java.
Understanding of, or ability to quickly assimilate and understand, assurance technologies and assurance foundations.
